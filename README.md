# MazeGenerator

I made this maze visualiser with a path finder as a project for my 11th grade CS class.
The maze generation uses a randomized depth-first search algorithm
The pathfinding is based on the A* pathfinding algorithm, which I simplified for mazes as diagonals aren't necessary

I'm using arcade for the visualisation
